Overview of the Project

Project: WEATHER FORECAST APP

Objective:

This WEATHER FORECAST APP was developed during my internship at Cod Tech IT Solutions.The objective of the Weather Forecast App project is to create a user-friendly web application that allows users to obtain current weather information for any city. This project aims to help developers enhance their skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while learning how to interact with external APIs.
Specifically, the app will:

Provide Real-Time Weather Information: Users can search for and view current weather conditions for any city they enter.
Enhance Front-End Development Skills: By building the app, developers will practice creating a responsive and visually appealing interface using HTML and CSS.
Integrate External APIs: Developers will learn how to fetch and display data from the OpenWeatherMap API, an essential skill for working with external data sources.
Improve JavaScript Proficiency: The project will involve manipulating the DOM, handling user input, and managing asynchronous requests using JavaScript.
Deliver a Practical Tool: The end product will be a practical and usable web application that users can benefit from in their daily lives.
